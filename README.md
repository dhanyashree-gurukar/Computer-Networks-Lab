## List of Programs

### Part-A : Implement the folowibg using C++/Java/Python

1. a) Use appropriate tool to find Host name, IP address, physical address, subnet mask, default gateway etc[hint: Ipconfig]. Explore different options available with the tool.   

   b) On the host system, identify the TCP connections, ports on which the computer is listening , Ethernet statistics, the IP routing table, IPV4 statistics, and IPV6 statistics etc. Using appropriate  tool[hint: netstat]. Explore different options available with the tool. 

2. Write a program to sort frames using appropriate sorting techniques.  

3. Write a program for error detecting code using CRC-CCITT(16-bits).  

4. Write a program to find the shortest path between vertices using bellman-ford algorithm.  

5. Using TCP/IP sockets, write a client - server program to make the client send the file name and to make the server send back the contents of the requested file if present.  

6. Write a program on datagram socket for client/server to display the messages on the client side, typed at the server side.  

7. Write a program for simple RSA algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the data.  

8. Write a program for congestion control using leaky bucket algorithm and token bucket algorithm.  

9. Write a program to implement random early detection(RED) congestion control algorithm.
